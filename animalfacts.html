  <h1> "Blue Sea Dragon? Dragons aren't even real to begin with, let alone Sea Dragons." is probably what your thinking but, the Blue Sea dragon is a actually a tiny sea slug with the scientific name "Glaucus atlanticus" and the common names like "blue sea dragon, sea swallow, blue angel, blue glaucus, dragon slug, etc". These cute little creatures casually float upside down and are carried by the wind and ocean currents. Doesn't that sound like the life? I like this animal because of it's vibrant blue color, it's size, and because they are extremly poisonous. A single sting from A blue sea dragon can cause nausea, severe pain, vomiting, and even death. I don't know about you but I think that's pretty cool. </h1>
